The project that can be found in this branch is not entirely mine. It was part of a group project for university.
It has been uploaded as a whole so as to be complete.

ABOUT THE PROJECT AND MY EXPERIENCE

The project was in the field of software engineering, more specifically in the paradigm of functional programming in F#. It was a group project in university. The goal was to create an ARM UAL emulator. In simple words, the team had to build a program that visualized the processes happening in an ARM processorâ€™s UAL unit. These can be split into two categories, memory operations and arithmetic operations. In the individual phase I was in charge of the memory operations and in the group stage I was in charge of the top-level architecture, more specifically creating a top-level file that would define all interfaces and connect all modules in a way that captures the complex process flow of an ARM UAL unit. The final touch was the testing of the whole program against a specified testbench and the connection to a UI. 



PARTS THAT ARE MINE
___________________

I hace created all the files relevant to the LDM and STM operations. That is, the files:

- LDM_STM.fs
- LDMSTMTest.fs
- MemDoc.md

Moreover, I have also created most of the top level file which serves as the interface and connects all individual modules,
that is the file:
- CommonTop
